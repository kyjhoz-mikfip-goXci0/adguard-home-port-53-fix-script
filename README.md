 #  AdGuard Home Port 53 Fix Script

The script is designed to free up port 53 on machiens with `systemd-resolved` using port 53.
 
This happens because the port 53 on `localhost`, which is used for DNS, is already taken by another program. Ubuntu comes with a local DNS called `systemd-resolved`, which uses the address `127.0.0.53:53` and thus prevents AdGuard Home from binding to `127.0.0.1:53`.

Please note that this script assumes that `systemd-resolved` is installed and running on your system. If itâ€™s not, you may need to install or start it before running this script. Also, please remember to make this script executable by running `chmod +x scriptname.sh` before executing it with `./install.sh`.
